# See https://discuss.elastic.co/t/logstash-errors-after-upgrading-to-filebeat-6-3-0/135984/
# for why we use this filter.
# tl;dr, Filebeat has a new `host` field in 6.3.x, but not in 6.2.x. However we need a new
# index in Elasticsearch to accomodate the new field, and this is thus backwards-incompatible,
# even though 6.x versions shouldn't have such breaking changes...
